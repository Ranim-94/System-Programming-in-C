# Repo Description

This repository contains the work for **system programming in C**.

It contains different project, resources such as books, documents,...

## Main resources

As resources I follow mainly the udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-system-programming-f/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING

Some nice references I found:

1- Linux System Programming Talking Directly to the Kernel and C Library, by Robert Love
    - contains nice introduction for each chapter, and general overview for system programming

2- Modern Operating System by ANDREW S. TANENBAUM and HERBERT BOS
    - system programming is an interdisplinary field between programming and operating system
    - this books explain all OS concpets clearly, and contains some code examples also

### Additional resources

To put the youtube channels I found later.
